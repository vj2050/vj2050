👩🏽‍💻 I am a Software Engineer and an open-source contributor with a focus on backend engineering and experience in developing full-stack web applications and chatbot applications utilizing Machine Learning.
  
🌱 I enjoy being challenged and engaging with projects that require me to work outside my comfort and knowledge set, as continuing to learn new languages and development techniques are important to me.
  
🎯 I am keen on taking challenges and making the most of the opportunities where I can put my abilities to work for a mission I am passionate about.
  
💡 Being a self-learner and researcher, I love tackling real-world problems by building technological solutions and have only driven to optimal solutions.
  
🚀 I am ready to take the next step where I can continue to grow and use the skills that I have honed in my academic and professional experience.
